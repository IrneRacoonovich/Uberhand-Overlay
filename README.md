## Getting Started

### Nintendo Switch Compatibility
To run the Uberhand overlay on the Nintendo Switch, you need to have the necessary homebrew environment set up on your console. Once you have the homebrew environment set up, you can transfer the compiled executable file to your Switch and launch it using the Tesla Overlay.

Please note that running homebrew software on your Nintendo Switch may void your warranty and can carry certain risks. Ensure that you understand the implications and follow the appropriate guidelines and precautions when using homebrew software.

### Compilation Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- TESLA library
- switch-jansson
- switch-curl
- switch-zziplib
- switch-mbedtls


### Usage

To use Uberhand, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named Uberhand in the config root folder on your SD card.
2. Place the config.ini package file in the Uberhand directory (or sub-directory). This package file contains the configuration options for Uberhand.
3. Your commands will show up on the Tesla menu within the Uberhand overlay. You can click A to execute any command, as well as click X to view and select the individual command lines written in the ini for execution.
