## Getting Started

### Nintendo Switch Compatibility
To run the Ultrahand File Management overlay on the Nintendo Switch, you need to have the necessary homebrew environment set up on your console. Once you have the homebrew environment set up, you can transfer the compiled executable file to your Switch and launch it using the Tesla Overlay.

Please note that running homebrew software on your Nintendo Switch may void your warranty and can carry certain risks. Ensure that you understand the implications and follow the appropriate guidelines and precautions when using homebrew software.

### Compilation Prerequisites

To compile and run the program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- TESLA library
- Standard C++ libraries


### Usage

To use Ultrahand, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory named ultrahand in the config root folder on your SD card.
2. Place the config.ini package file in the ultrahand directory (or sub-directory). This package file contains the configuration options for Ultrahand.
3. Your commands will show up on the Tesla menu within the Ultrahand overlay.  You can click A to execute any command as well as click X to view the indivicual command lines written in the ini for execution.

## Configuration Options

The config.ini file contains multiple sections, each defining a set of commands that can be executed. The sections are enclosed in square brackets [ ], and the commands are listed below each section.

Here's an example of the config.ini file:
```
[make directories]
mkdir /switch/.packages/example1/
mkdir /switch/.packages/example2/

[copy files]
copy /switch/.packages/config.ini /switch/.packages/example1/
copy /switch/.packages/config.ini /switch/.packages/example2/

[rename files]
move /switch/.packages/example1/config.ini /switch/.packages/example1/configX.ini
move /switch/.packages/example2/config.ini /switch/.packages/example2/configX.ini

[move directories]
move /switch/.packages/example1/ /switch/.packages/example3/
move /switch/.packages/example2/ /switch/.packages/example4/

[delete files]
delete /switch/.packages/example1/config.ini
delete /switch/.packages/example2/config.ini

[delete directories]
delete /switch/.packages/example1/
delete /switch/.packages/example2/
delete /switch/.packages/example3/
delete /switch/.packages/example4/

[modify ini file]
copy /bootloader/hekate_ipl.ini /switch/.packages/
set-ini-val /switch/.packages/hekate_ipl.ini 'Atmosphere' fss0 gonnawritesomethingelse
set-ini-val â€‹/switch/.packages/hekate_ipl.ini 'Atmosphere' booty true
```
You can add your own sections and commands to customize the actions performed by Ultrahand.

Note: The paths specified in the commands should be relative to the SD card root directory and should end with /.
